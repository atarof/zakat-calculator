🧮 Zakat Calculator
A simple web app to help users calculate their Zakāt (obligatory charity) due each lunar year.
It fetches gold and silver prices from GoldAPI.io to determine the threshold which Zakāt becomes compulsory(referred to as the "Nisab").

💱 Threshold values are displayed in USD and GBP, allowing users to easily calculate how much Zakāt they owe based on their assets.
